                    <p class="lead">Scientists have been well aware of global warming for several years. A United
                        Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2007 warned that artificial
                        greenhouse gas emissions are the likely cause of global warming, which was supported by over
                        2000 climate scientists, including Canadians. Climate scientists predict that
                        Canada will be especially impacted due to its cold weather. Canada has 9% of the global
                        renewable water supply, with nearly 900,000 square kilometres of water. Climate
                        change would affect Canadaâ€™s geography if this water were to disappear, and prairies could
                        experience drought and forest fires.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Canada signed the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, a treaty between countries to reduce
                        greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. The 2006 Clean Air Act
                        implemented under the Harper government created GHG emission regulations on industries,
                        including the automobile industry. The government also reduced taxes when using a transit pass,
                        to encourage the use of public transportation. However, the Harper government was against the
                        Kyoto Protocol, as they claimed it would affect the economy by limiting the use of GHGs - they
                        decided to back out of the treaty in 2011. Justin Trudeau was the first prime minister to act on
                        the climate change issue, promising that Canada would play an international leadership role at
                        COP21.</p>

                    <p class="lead">On June 21, 2018, the federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act was implemented.
                        The first part of the act imposes taxes on fuels for distributors, while the second part taxes
                        large companies that exceed emissions limits. However, this tax only applies if provinces and
                        territories do not develop their own taxation plan. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario asked
                        their appeal courts to decide if the act is constitutional, and the Alberta court decided that
                        it is unconstitutional, while the Saskatchewan and Ontario appeal courts decided that it is.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Section 91 of the Constitution Act discusses what heads of power (specific areas)
                        the federal government can make laws on, and section 92 similarly discusses heads of power for
                        provincial governments. A division of powers problem occurs when it is not clear which
                        government has the authority to enact laws in a certain area - in this case, climate change was
                        not an issue when the Constitution was written, therefore a division of powers problem occurred.
