                    <p class="lead">Scientists have been well aware of global warming for several years. A United
                        Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2007 warned that artificial
                        greenhouse gas emissions are the likely cause of global warming, which was supported by over
                        2000 climate scientists, including Canadians. Climate scientists predict that
                        Canada will be especially impacted due to its cold weather. Canada has 9% of the global
                        renewable water supply, with nearly 900,000 square kilometres of water. Climate
                        change would affect Canada’s geography if this water were to disappear, and prairies could
                        experience drought and forest fires.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Canada signed the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, a treaty between countries to reduce
                        greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. The 2006 Clean Air Act
                        implemented under the Harper government created GHG emission regulations on industries,
                        including the automobile industry. The government also reduced taxes when using a transit pass,
                        to encourage the use of public transportation. However, the Harper government was against the
                        Kyoto Protocol, as they claimed it would affect the economy by limiting the use of GHGs - they
                        decided to back out of the treaty in 2011. In addition, critics pointed out that countries such
                        as India and China were not made to join the agreement. However, the map on the left shows that
                        Canada produces 14.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per person, compared to just 2 tonnes
                        for India, and 8 for China. There is a clear need for a plan to reduce these emissions. Justin
                        Trudeau was the first prime minister to act on the climate change issue, promising that Canada
                        would play an international leadership role in combatting climate change at COP21.</p>

                    <p class="lead">On June 21, 2018, the federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act was implemented.
                        The first part of the act imposes taxes on fuels for distributors, while the second part taxes
                        large companies that exceed emissions limits. However, this tax only applies if provinces and
                        territories do not develop their own taxation plan. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario asked
                        their appeal courts to decide if the act is constitutional, and the Alberta court decided that
                        it is unconstitutional, while the Saskatchewan and Ontario appeal courts decided that it is.</p>

            <p class="lead pb-3">Section 91 of the Constitution Act discusses what heads of power (specific areas)
                the federal government can make laws on, and section 92 similarly discusses heads of power for
                provincial governments. A division of powers problem occurs when it is not clear which
                government has the authority to enact laws in a certain area - in this case, climate change was
                not an issue when the Constitution was written, therefore a division of powers problem occurred. The
                federal government used the national concern branch to justify the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act.

            <h1 class="fw-bold text-white pt-5 py-3">Supreme Court Decision</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                Chief Justice Richard Wagner decided that the federal government can impose a tax as the issue of
                climate change is pressing and threatens human existence. The POGG (peace, order, and good government)
                clause, described in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution, justifies the enactment of laws by the
                federal government to solve problems affecting the country as a whole. If provinces independently
                imposed taxes, and one province did not enact a carbon tax policy, the issue would not be solved. This
                is a result of climate change not having borders - if one province emits greenhouse gases, the impacts
                will be felt in other provinces as well. The federal carbon tax would only apply if provinces refused to
                implement their own taxes, therefore having a limited impact on the freedom of provincial governments.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Justices Brown and Rowe disagreed with Wagner, mainly discussing how not abiding by the Constitution
                would give the federal government too much power. Brown wrote that allowing the federal government to
                impose a carbon tax would encourage them to take away freedom from provinces, allowing them to impose
                standards on trading, health, and resource management, which all fall under provincial jurisdiction.
                Rowe wrote that the POGG clause should only be used as a last resort in an emergency situation, as it
                takes away the freedom of provincial governments and grants the federal government more power.

                        La Rose v. His Majesty the King is a case involving 15 Canadian teenage plaintiffs. They
                        argue that youth are being harmed by climate change, resulting in two Charter rights violations.
                        They have been arguing that the government infringed on their right to life, liberty, security
                        of the person, as well as discriminating on the basis of age, as youth will be
                        disproportionately impacted by climate change in the future. The plaintiffs are not seeking
                        money in this lawsuit, and instead have the intention of pressuring governments to take action
                        by proving that they are infringing on the Charter rights of Canadians

                    <p class="lead">Climate change is a new and evolving legal issue. There are not many climate change
                        laws and cases - when the Constitution was written, climate change was not considered as a part
                        of it, as it was nonexistent at the time. As a result, laws on climate change will continue to
                        change within the next 10-20 years. It is still debated whether or not climate change is real,
                        and science is being ignored, but as the impacts of pollution on the climate become increasingly
                        visible and progressively worse, it will be undeniable that climate change is a real problem -
                        the recent forest fires in Canada and the USA, as well as extreme weather events, provide
                        irrefutable evidence of this issue. It is clear from the graph that per capita emissions have
                        overall risen significantly. Better tax policies must be implemented to hold companies
                        accountable for their contributions to climate change, and eventually the pressure from
                        increasing taxation could force large companies to stop producing, distributing, and consuming
                        fossil fuels, and the government may additionally make policies to further limit these.

            <p class="lead">
                Canadian human rights laws and their interpretation by the courts are influenced by changing societal
                values
                and beliefs, and political trends. Society is beginning to place a larger importance on the issue of
                climate
                change, as is evident by the election campaigns of political parties, in which they bring up their plans
                for
                combatting it. As climate change awareness increases, political parties are changing their views. For
                example, most Conservatives are against the idea of acting to combat climate change. However, Erin
                O’Toole,
                the previous leader of the Conservative Party, has stated that the party’s policies must change to
                succeed
                in the elections, as the threat to the climate increases, and they cannot continue to deny the existence
                of
                this threat without facing criticism from society and losing votes (Tasker, 2021). These changing
                societal
                and political beliefs will affect the interpretation of human rights laws by the justice system - the
                case
                of La Rose v. His Majesty the King shows that the government’s inaction on climate change should
                be
                considered an infringement on Canadian Charter rights, which will be more likely to succeed as society
                begins to place a greater importance on climate change.
